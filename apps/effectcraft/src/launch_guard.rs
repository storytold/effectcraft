//! Settings ▸ Startup & Repair ▸ Window Graphics, and the launch guard behind it.
//!
//! Some graphics drivers crash Visualab Effects as its window's device is created (an access
//! violation in an older Intel UHD driver with DirectX 12 / Vulkan, #243), or a moment after
//! its first frame, as the window is shown and its surface re-created (AMD's Vulkan driver for
//! a Radeon RX 6800M, Adrenalin 26.9.2: an access violation in amdvlk64.dll on every launch).
//! A crash in a driver can't be caught, so each launch leaves a marker in the settings folder
//! until its window has kept drawing for [`SETTLE`] (or the app quits normally before then). A
//! launch that finds the previous one's marker switches Window Graphics to OpenGL, which those
//! drivers run, and says so once the window is up. `WGPU_BACKEND` (wgpu's own override) still
//! wins over both. The marker is locked while its launch runs, so a second copy opened meanwhile
//! isn't taken for a crash; and a window OpenGL can't open either puts Window Graphics back to
//! Automatic ([`opengl_failed`]) rather than failing every launch.
