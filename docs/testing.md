# Testing

```sh
cargo test --workspace     # everything
cargo xtask ci             # fmt, clippy -D warnings, tests, layers, assets, wasm
```

## What the tests cover

- **Engine commands** (`crates/engine/src/tests*.rs`): every command family, including undo and
  redo, and that every menu entry resolves to a registered command.
- **Rendering** (`crates/render`): pixel checks on small compositions, for blend modes, masks,
  mattes, time remapping, 3D projection, lighting and shadows. Fast paths (the layer cache, the
  affine compositor, blurs, motion blur accumulation) are checked against their reference
  implementations.
- **Effects** (`crates/effects`): each effect has a determinism test and at least one behaviour
  test (identity at neutral settings, known pixel results, or simulations giving the same frame
  whether you seek straight to it or play up to it). A registry-wide test checks that effects
  which read the clock are declared time-dependent. `crates/effects/tests/sim_golden.rs` pins
  exact pixel hashes of the simulation effects the GPU shares plans with (CC Rainfall … Card
  Wipe) at several settings, times, bit depths and resolutions, so any change to their CPU output
  fails (re-pin with `SIM_GOLDEN_PRINT=1` after an intended change; pinned for aarch64 macOS,
  with the hashes another macOS release's libm gives for unchanged code in `LIBM_VARIANTS`).
- **Export** (`crates/export/tests`): every format is encoded and decoded back, checking frame
  count, size and pixels. When `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` are installed they are used as an outside
  check; they are never linked or shipped.
- **Automation** (`crates/automation`, `apps/effectcraft-cli/tests`): MCP protocol round trips and
  the command-line tool's JSON output.
- **Interface** (`crates/ui-egui`): headless egui_kittest tests for panels and dialogs.

## Looking at the interface without a window

```sh
cargo run -p effectcraft-ui-egui --example snapshot -- --out ui.png \
  --step '{"method":"engine.execute","params":{"command":"layer.select","params":{"layers":["#2"]}}}'
```

Each `--step` is a control-channel request; `{"method":"snap","params":{"path":"x.png"}}` writes an
intermediate image.

## Benchmarks

```sh
cargo run --release -p effectcraft-cli -- bench --n 10 --play 30
```

prints per-layer and per-effect timings for one frame, and playback timings with and without the
layer cache.

### Render benchmark (`cargo xtask bench`)

```sh
nice -n 10 cargo xtask bench --bin target/release/effectcraft-cli   # or no --bin: one `--release` build into target/bench
nice -n 10 cargo xtask bench --quick --compare before.jsonl        # 8 frames instead of 60, % change against an earlier run
cargo xtask bench --project F.ecproj --comp "Main"                 # any project's comp
```

measures memory, CPU and wall time of whole `effectcraft-cli` runs, so every optimisation has a
before and after number. It generates four deterministic scenarios into `target/bench/projects`
with engine commands (no committed media): `demo` (the built-in demo comp), `layers` (1080p,
100 solid, text and shape layers with Gaussian Blur, Glow, Levels, Curves, Drop Shadow and
keyframes), `precomps` (static and animated precomps nested three deep, each used several times)
and `footage` (a rendered PNG sequence and H.264 clip on several 1080p layers, plus a 4K still).
Each is opened (`open`), rendered at Full and Half (PNG sequence, deleted afterwards) and as one
frame. `/usr/bin/time -l` on macOS gives peak memory footprint, max RSS, user + sys CPU and
instructions retired; `/usr/bin/time -v` on Linux gives max RSS and CPU; elsewhere wall time only.

It prints a table and appends one JSON line per run to `target/bench/results.jsonl` (git rev,
date, load average, scenario, settings, metrics); `--compare OLD.jsonl` prints the % change against
the latest matching runs there, `--compare OLD --with NEW` compares two files without rendering.
The table notes the 1-minute load average: on a busy machine wall time is noise, so compare
peak memory and instructions retired, and rerun when the load differs a lot.

## Deep font libraries and directory aliases

DirectorySource walks directory branches iteratively rather than stopping at a fixed nesting
level. Tests discover an existing licensed Inter font sixteen directories deep, preserve final
sorted path order and duplicate-root handling, and on Unix preserve sibling aliases while
skipping self/parent cycles and broken links. Regular-file symlinks remain supported.

On Unix, device/inode identities detect repeated ancestors, including directory aliases. Other
platforms use canonical paths for branch identity. This is not a promise of identical bind-mount
identity on every platform. A branch retains directory handles proportional to its depth; OS
resource and filesystem errors are still skipped. All noncyclic alias branches are visited. Work and retained paths have no new entry or byte
cutoff; alias-rich graphs can repeat physical subtrees many times. Concurrent
filesystem changes and blocking filesystem operations have no hard latency guarantee. No
Fontconfig matching or configuration-file selection behavior changes here.
